# Pickling and unpickling objects

Vendored from `Batteries.Util.Pickle` so loogle does not depend on
batteries directly.

open Lean System

/--
Save an object to disk.
If you need to write multiple objects from within a single declaration,
you will need to provide a unique `key` for each.
-/
def pickle {α : Type} (path : FilePath) (x : α) (key : Name := by exact decl_name%) : IO Unit :=
  saveModuleData path key (unsafe unsafeCast x)

/--
Load an object from disk.
Note: The returned `CompactedRegion` can be used to free the memory behind the value
of type `α`, using `CompactedRegion.free` (which is only safe once all references to the `α` are
released). Ignoring the `CompactedRegion` results in the data being leaked.

This function is unsafe because the data being loaded may not actually have type `α`, and this
may cause crashes or other bad behavior.

unsafe def unpickle (α : Type) (path : FilePath) : IO (α × CompactedRegion) := do
  let (x, region) ← readModuleData path
  pure (unsafeCast x, region)
